_A completely asynchronous and fluid Scala client for the [Chef][0] API_

Chef provides a robust and powerful platform for deploying hardware at scale with consistency,
 this library provide a easy to use wrapper for the [Chef API][1]

Issues and Contributing
=======================

Whilst this library aims to cover all bases there will be pit falls. If you run
into an issue or would like a new endpoint to be implemented that isn't in the library
already, then just open an issue and I will get to it as soon as possible.

If you are feeling extra brave, it would be awesome for you to also create a pull
request with what you think might be the solution.

To contribute, just follow these steps:

  1. Fork from the `stable` branch
  2. Create a new `feature`/`
  3. Implemented your changes
  4. Ensure all tests pass (See `TESTING.md`)
  5. Updated the `Authors and Copyright` table, add your name, email and copyright statement
  6. Submit the pull requests with your changes
